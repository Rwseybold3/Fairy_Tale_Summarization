# Fairy_Tale_Summarization
For this project, I utilized extractive summarization to try to summarize fairy tales in a logical manner.
This was done through creating similarity matrices of the sentences in each story and extracting the top 5 most similar sentences. 
A major goal of this project was 1) create a logical summary of a given fairy tale and 2) possibly see how well these summaries do 
at actually extracting the hidden moral of a story. Overall, the algorithm adequately summarized around 50% of the stories. An improvement that could
be implemented is the use of abstractive summarization techniques which can create novel sentences. These may be able to parse out the nuances
of the strings more.
